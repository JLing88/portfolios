Idea Box

* [Original Assignment]()

(Idea box was a challenge for me. I was a bit foggy on some of the topics initially. I used this project as a tool to refine my knowlege of rails. It is a basic application to track user ideas, images, and categories. It also implements authentication and authorization using User models with an elevated role for Admins.)
